#A student proposes to study the gravitational force by suspending two 111.0-kg spherical objects at the lower ends of cables from the ceiling of a tall cathedral and measuring the deflection of the cables from the vertical. The 38.00-m-long cables are attached to the ceiling 1.000 m apart. The first object is suspended, and its position is carefully measured. The second object is suspended, and the two objects attract each other gravitationally. By what distance has the first object moved horizontally from its initial position due to the gravitational attraction to the other object? Suggestion: Keep in mind that this distance will be very small and make appropriate approximations.

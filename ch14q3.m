# The small piston of a hydraulic lift (see figure below) has a cross-sectional area of 3.10 cm2, and its large piston has a cross-sectional area of 201 cm2. What downward force of magnitude F1 must be applied to the small piston for the lift to raise a load whose weight is Fg = 14.4 kN?

as = 3.1;
al = 201;

Fg = 14.4e3;

F = Fg*as/al

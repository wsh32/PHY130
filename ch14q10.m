#A hypodermic syringe contains a medicine with the density of water (see figure below). The barrel of the syringe has a cross-sectional area A = 2.00  10-5 m2, and the needle has a cross-sectional area a = 1.00  10-8 m2. In the absence of a force on the plunger, the pressure everywhere is 1.00 atm. A force F with arrow of magnitude 2.75 N acts on the plunger, making medicine squirt horizontally from the needle. Determine the speed of the medicine as it leaves the needle's tip.

A = 2e-5;
F = 2.75;

v2 = sqrt(2*F/A*1000)

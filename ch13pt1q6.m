#Two planets X and Y travel counterclockwise in circular orbits about a star as shown in the figure below. The radii of their orbits are in the ratio 4:3. At one moment, they are aligned as shown in figure (a), making a straight line with the star. During the next five years, the angular displacement of planet X is 90.0Â° as shown in figure (b). What is the angular displacement of planet Y at this moment?

rx = 4;
ry = 3;

wy = (90/5)*(rx/ry)^(3/2)/360

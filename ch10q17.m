# In the figure below, the hanging object has a mass of m1 = 0.500 kg; the sliding block has a mass of m2 = 0.815 kg; and the pulley is a hollow cylinder with a mass of M = 0.350 kg, an inner radius of R1 = 0.020 0 m, and an outer radius of R2 = 0.030 0 m. Assume the mass of the spokes is negligible. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the horizontal surface is Î¼k = 0.250. The pulley turns without friction on its axle. The light cord does not stretch and does not slip on the pulley. The block has a velocity of vi = 0.820 m/s toward the pulley when it passes a reference point on the table.

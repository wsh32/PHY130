#The spring of the pressure gauge shown in the figure below has a force constant of 1 350 N/m, and the piston has a diameter of 1.50 cm. As the gauge is lowered into water in a lake, what change in depth causes the piston to move in by 0.450 cm?

k = 1350;
r = 1.5 / 200;
x = .45 / 100;
g = 9.81;

h = k*x/((pi*r^2)*(g*1000))
